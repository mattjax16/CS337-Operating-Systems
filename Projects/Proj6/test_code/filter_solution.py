This is the filter solution which is the n+threads Peterson solution basically.

Here the flags are instead called levels, are a numpy array of integers (
representing each thread process) that is thread_count in size and it acts as
the queue representation for the threads, it is used to indicate the position
of each thread (which queue it is in) . A thread must wait until it is at the
end of the waiting queue to run its critical section.T turns instead be will
be made into a thread_count - 1 sized array and called last_to_enter because
it is used mainly to keep track of the last thread to enter the queue at each
level, this is to make sure there are not 2 threads running at the same time
(end of the queue). This helps with mutal exclusion because `pos` exits the
inner loop when there is either no process with a higher level than `level[
thread_idx]`, so the next waiting room is free; or, when `thread_idx !=
last_to_enter[pos]`, so another process joined its waiting room. At level
zero, then, even if all thread_count processes were to enter waiting room
zero at the same time, no more than thread_count âˆ’ 1 will proceed to the next
room, the final one finding itself the last to enter the room. This then goes
on recursively for all the threads. If it is easier to think of the levels
and last to enter can be thought almost as a 2d matrix that is thread_count -
1 by thread_count.
