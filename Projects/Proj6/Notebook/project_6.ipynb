    "  testing the critical section is the `increment` function. because to\n",
    "  increment the thread must first read the value of the global variable x and\n",

    "customers). Numbers increase by one as customers enter the store (in this\n",
    "algorithm the threads get a ticket number when they want to enter the\n",
    "critical section ). A global counter displays the number of the customer that\n",
    " is currently being served (in the context of this is the `choosing` list\n",
    " which is has true in the position of which thread is accessing the critical\n",
    " section, acts as a doorway step).\n",
    " All other customers\n",
    "must wait in a queue until the baker finishes serving the current customer\n",
    "and the next number is displayed. When the customer is done shopping and has\n",

    "In this bakery solution class the reasoning for having a chossing array that\n",

    "ticket number for each thread is due to the fact that the function for\n",
    "assigning a ticket number to the thread being locked is not atomic (` self\n",
    ".tickets[thread_idx] = np.max(self.tickets) + 1`), getting the max of the\n",
    "array is really iterating over every entry and reading it so this leads to it\n",

    " higher-priority process was preempted before setting the ticket number the\n",

    " ignore the equal ticket number for lower-priority processes, and also enters\n",
    " the critical section. SO by using the `choosing` array it makes the code for\n",
    "  choosing a ticket number 'seem' atomic. This is because we wait for all threads to be done picking a\n",
    "  ticker number before the critical section for the thread that is using the\n",
