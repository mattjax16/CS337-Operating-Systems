# CS337 - OPERATING SYSTEMS- Project 5 Multitasking
#### By: Matthew Bass


**Project Overview:**
    
In this assignment, you will revisit a familiar project from CS231.  We will 
write a program to process eight years of Reddit comments to find the most common words overall and in each year.  This assignment is intentionally vague to give you room to be creative in your solutions.  

You will be graded based on:
- Your choice of data structure for each part of the project (you can use any 
Python library).
- How you apply multiprocessing and multithreading to speed up your code.
- The improvement, in run time, over running the code serially.
