# CS337 - OPERATING SYSTEMS- Project 2 Preemptive CPU Scheduling - 2022
#### By: Matthew Bass


**Project Overview:**
    
In this assignment, I created simulations of the CPU scheduling aspects 
of an Operating System Kernel and implemented the following scheduling 
algorithms:
        
    1. RR: Round Robin
    2. SRT: Shortest Remaining Time
    3. PP: Preemptive Priority
    4. MLFQ: Multilevel Feedback Queue
